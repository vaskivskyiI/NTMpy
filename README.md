# What does NTMpy solves
NTMpy is a python package to solve 1D diffusion equation with 2 or 3 temperature coupled

The equation under consideration is:

$$
\begin{cases}
C_{Ei}\cdot\rho_i\cdot\partial_t T_E = \partial_x(k_{Ei}\cdot\partial_xT_E)+G_{ELi}\cdot(T_L-T_E)+G_{ESi}\cdot(T_S-T_E)+S(x,t)\\
C_{Li}\cdot\rho_i\cdot\partial_t T_L = \partial_x(k_{Li}\cdot\partial_xT_L)+G_{ELi}\cdot(T_E-T_L)+G_{LSi}\cdot(T_S-T_L)\\
C_{Si}\cdot\rho_i\cdot\partial_t T_S = \partial_x(k_{Si}\cdot\partial_xT_S)+G_{ESi}\cdot(T_E-T_S)+G_{LSi}\cdot(T_L-T_S)
\end{cases}
$$
 
where </br>
$T_E(x,t)$, $T_L(x,t)$, and $T_S(x,t)$ are temperature (subscripts recall Electron, Lattice, and Spin) </br>
$\rho$ is the mass density in the $i$-th layer of material (the material properties are piecewise homogeneous) </br>
$C_{Ki}$ and $k_{Ki}$ are the specific heat and thermal conductivity of the system $K = E,L,S$ in the $i$-th layer of material </br>
$G_{KHi}$ is the thermal coupling coefficient between the system $K$ and $H$ (with $K,H\in \lbrace E,L,S\rbrace$) in the $i$-th layer </br>
$S(x,t)$ is the energy generation/ source </br>

The material properties $C_{Ki}(T_E,T_L,T_S)$, $k_{Ki}(T_E,T_L,T_S)$, and $G_{KH}(T_E,T_L,T_S)$ are function of the three temperatures </br>
The dependance on temperature are non-dispersive, i.e. they depend on the temperature in the same point at the same time

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{Ki}(x,t) = C_{Ki}(T_E(x,t),T_L(x,t),T_S(x,t))\\
k_{Ki}(x,t) = k_{Ki}(T_E(x,t),T_L(x,t),T_S(x,t))\\
G_{KHi}(x,t) = G_{KHi}(T_E(x,t),T_L(x,t),T_S(x,t))
\end{aligned}$$

The solution is obtained using the Finite Element Method (FEM) + explicit Euler method. The FEM uses B-splines + collocation method.

# How to install
The standard version of NTMpy, which follows the documentation on the original udcm-su [repository](https://github.com/udcm-su/NTMpy), can be installed via `pip install NTMpy`.</br>
The version on this repository is a successive version, currently under development. You can use it by cloning the repository and instering the code fonder in your path or by manually importing it.

# How to use NTMpy
NTMpy provides a set of classes to simulate coupled heat equation with 2 or 3 temperature in a multilayer system.
The simulation parameters are customizable, but the codes can choose them automatically if not given by the user.

Here is an example:
```python
from Sim2T import Sim2T 
import Visual as vs 
from Source import source 

# Initialize source
s = source() # default option, Gaussian pulse
s.setLaser(5, 2e-12)
s.delay       = 2e-12       # time the maximum intensity hits
s.refraction  = [1,1]
s.absorption  = [1.9e-7, 1.9e-7]


# initialize simulation: ntm.simulation(number of temperatures, source)
sim = Sim2T() # Default initial temperature: 300 Kelvin
sim.setSource(s)

# add material layers:
# addLayer(length, [kE, kL], [CE, CL], density, G_EL, spline_number)
sim.addLayer( 30e-9, [ 8,  0], [lambda T: .112*T, 450], 6500, 6e17, 9)
sim.addLayer( 80e-9, [24, 12], [lambda T: .025*T, 730], 5100, 6e17, 12)

# set final simulation time (in seconds)
sim.final_time = 50e-12

# Run simulation
[x, t, phi] = sim.run()
    
# Plot temperature
vs.compare(x,t,phi[0],phi[1])
```

The ouput `phi` is a 3D array with the following structure:
* the first index selects the temperature: `phi[0]` is the electron temperature, `phi[1]` is the lattice temperature.
* the second index is the space position: `phi[0][0]` is the temperature on the surface, `phi[0][10]` is the temperature in the 10th point of the grid.
* the third index is the time instant: `phi[0][0][100]` is the temperature of the temperature of the surface after 100 time steps.

# How to contribute
New features for NTMpy are currently under development, but with a very slow pace. A graphic interface is under development using [eel](https://github.com/python-eel/Eel).</br>
If there is any important feature you think is missing and it is important for the experiments, you can open an issue on this repository.</br>
If you want to contribute to the code development, you can either clone this directory or contact the author [Valentino Scalera](mailto:valentino.scalera@uniparthenope.it).</br>
Any collaboration would be very appreciated

## Dependencies
NTMpy has four dependencies: [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [B-splines](https://github.com/johntfoster), and [Progressbar](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/2.2.3/)

You can download the package via `pip install NTMpy` a automatically install the missing packages. Note that the NTMpy available on PyPi is an old version!
